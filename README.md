### :bulb: In a nutshell

µWebSockets.js is a C++ implementation of the Http/WebSocket protocols for Node.js, easy to use from JavaScript. Being written in native code directly targeting the Linux kernel makes it faster than anything you can script inside Node.js. Technically speaking it is a binding to [µWebSockets](https://github.com/uNetworking/uWebSockets), so make sure to read that page as well.

Demonstrative benchmark as of 2020-06-09:

Conceptually, think of it as a complete replacement to both Express.js and Socket.IO. It carries both a router and pub/sub support.

Browse the [documentation](https://unetworking.github.io/uWebSockets.js/generated/). There are tons of [examples](examples) but here's the gist of it all:

```javascript
/* Non-SSL is simply App() */
require('uWebSockets.js').SSLApp({

  /* There are tons of SSL options */
  key_file_name: 'misc/key.pem',
  cert_file_name: 'misc/cert.pem',
  
}).ws('/*', {

  /* For brevity we skip the other events */
  message: (ws, message, isBinary) => {
    let ok = ws.send(message, isBinary);
  }
  
}).any('/*', (res, req) => {

  /* Let's deny all Http */
  res.end('Nothing to see here!');
  
}).listen(9001, (listenSocket) => {

  if (listenSocket) {
    console.log('Listening to port 9001');
  }
  
});
```

### :rocket: Ready all thrusters

Install with `npm install uNetworking/uWebSockets.js#v18.1.0` or any such [release](https://github.com/uNetworking/uWebSockets.js/releases). No compiler needed.

Real-world tests over TLS 1.3 and Ethernet puts us **5x** as efficient as Socket.IO, **2x** as efficient as websockets/ws.
